Ethrex Explorer API
===================

Ethrex is an Ethereum blockchain explorer that uses a custom instrumented EVM to sync
Ethereum blockchain state with a relational datastore and realtime web backend. Most
capabilities of the `online explorer <https://ethrex.io>`_ are exposed via a public HTTP
and websocket-capable API, documented here.

To use the Ethrex API on your website, you will need an API key. To obtain one, please contact `support@ethrex.io <mailto:support@ethrex.io>`_
and specify the parameters of your project and intended API usage. Access for personal, low volume usage is free of charge.
High-volume accommodations are negotiable.

.. note::
  The Ethrex API is currently in public beta. Interfaces will be held stable on a best-effort basis.
  Ethrex does not provide guarantees as to uptime of any services documented herein.
